## Project Overview

In this project, I was assigned by Coalition Technologies to test my frontend development skills. The goal was to implement a design provided in a mock design PSD file into a fully functional webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM manipulation. The main objective was to create a webpage that replicates the design as closely as possible while ensuring responsiveness and interactivity.
